## Introduction
HTML is short for Hyper-Text Markup Language, it is responsible for **structuring** a webpage.

## Structure
The use of structure reflects the hierarchy and importance of information displayed. In HTML, tags are incorporated into the code to represent different sections and importance wise. For example, the `<h1>` tag displays a big heading, which is also the first *information* that gets picked up by the search engine.

## HTML5 Layout
HTML5 Layout allows for splitting the page into sections. For example, there is the *header* tag, which allows us to place the logo and the navigation bar at the top of the page.

The *footer* tag specifies that copyright information and other links can be put at the bottom of the page.

## Process & Design
Every website is designed for the target audience, this should be reflected in the design. The website shouldn't be designed for you or the site owner only. Most visitors of your website will visit for a reason, you must discover the underlying motivations and goals of the visitor, so you can properly display the website.


## JavaScript
**JavaScript** is a programming language used to add interactivity to your website and make it more dynamic. It can take inputs and display outputs and can be triggered with events such a mouse click or a scroll.

A *script* is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a certain goal. It can be compared to a recipe that is followed to make a certain dish.
