## Forms

HTML Forms are required, when you want to collect some data from the site visitor. For example, during user registration you would like to collect information such as name, email address, credit card, etc.

A form will take input from the site visitor and then will post it to a back-end application such as CGI, ASP Script or PHP script etc. The back-end application will perform required processing on the passed data based on defined business logic inside the application.

There are various form elements available like text fields, textarea fields, drop-down menus, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.

## Tables

Tables can be a useful way of organising content on a web page, particularly text.

A table is defined with the `<table>` tag.
Each row in the table is defined with the `<tr>` tag.
A table heading is defined with the `<th>` tag. (Headings are bold and centred by default.)
Each cell of data in the table is defined with the `<td>` tag.

## Events

Reacting to Events
A JavaScript can be executed when an event occurs, like when a user clicks on an HTML element.

To execute code when a user clicks on an element, add JavaScript code to an HTML event attribute:

onclick=JavaScript
Examples of HTML events:

When a user clicks the mouse
When a web page has loaded
When an image has been loaded
When the mouse moves over an element
When an input field is changed
When an HTML form is submitted
When a user strokes a key
