## Images

**Controlling** the size and alignment of
your images using CSS keeps rules that
affect the presentation of your page in
the CSS and out of the HTML markup.

You can control the *size* of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.
Specifying image sizes helps
pages to load more smoothly
because the HTML and CSS
code will often load before the
images, and telling the browser
how much space to leave for an
image allows it to render the rest
of the page without waiting for
the image to download.
You might think that your site
is likely to have images of all
different sizes, but a lot of sites
use the same sized image across
many of their pages. 

By default, images are inline
elements. This means that they
flow within the surrounding text.
In order to center an image, it
should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display
property with a value of block.
Once it has been made into a
block-level element, there are
two common ways in which you
can horizontally center an image:
1: On the containing element,
you can use the text-align
property with a value of center.
2: On the image itself, you can
use the use the margin property
and set the values of the left and
right margins to auto.

## Practical Information

**SEO** is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject.
The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can
improve your website's visibility on search engines.

**As soon** as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing
how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are
leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by
Google called Google Analytics.

**There are a number of online**
services that allow you to point
your domain name to their
servers. Blogging platforms such
as WordPress.com, Tumblr,
and Posterous, or e-commerce
platforms such as Big Cartel and
Shopify provide the servers that
your site is hosted on. If you are
using a platform like this you
will not need your own hosting
for the website, although you
often still need hosting for your
email. If this is the case, some
web hosting companies offer
packages that will just offer
email services.
