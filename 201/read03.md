## Lists
Lists come in 3 different types:

**Ordered Lists** are lists which are numbered. For example:
1. Shake
2. Open
3. Eat

It can be used for recipes, which should be followed directly from 1...end.

**Unordered Lists** are lists with bullet points and don't matter the sequence. For Example:
+ Apples
+ Bananas
+ Oranges

**Definiton Lists** are made up of a set of terms along with a definition for each term. For example:
<dl>
<dt>Hello</dt>
<dd>is a greeting used in the English language.</dd>
</dl>

## Boxes
Any element in the HTML document is encapsulated with a box. Some terms that can specify the width and height of these boxes are:
+ Padding
+ Margin
+ Border

**Padding** refers to the space between the element and its outer box. Where you can add space to the element to cause it to have more room.

**Margin** is the space between each element in the HTML document. For instance, if we added 5 pixels to the margin in CSS, each element will be 5 pixels apart.

## Javascript Switch Function
> A switch statement starts with a
variable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible
value for this variable and the
code that should run if the
variable matches that value.
