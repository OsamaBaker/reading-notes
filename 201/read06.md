> from page 183 on Javascript Book

The DOM tree is a model of the webpage.

The terms elements and element nodes are used interchangeably
but when people say the DOM is working with an element,
it is actually working with a node that represents that element.

DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist,
which is a collection of nodes.

When a DOM method can return more than one element, it returns a
Nodelist (even if it only finds one matching element).
