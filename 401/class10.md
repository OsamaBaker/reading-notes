# Event Driven Applications

1. Why is access control important?
> Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems.

2. Describe an application that would need access control.
> Canvas.

3. What is a role used for?
> Within an organization, roles are created for various job functions. The permissions to perform certain operations are assigned to specific roles

4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
> Unlike Mandatory Access Control (MAC) where access to system resources is controlled by the operating system (under the control of a system administrator), Discretionary Access Control (DAC) allows each user to control access to their own data.

Authorization - Authorization is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to general information security and computer security, and to access control in particular.

Role Based Access Control - is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users.

Capabilities - A capability (known in some systems as a key) is a communicable, unforgeable token of authority. It refers to a value that references an object along with an associated set of access rights.
