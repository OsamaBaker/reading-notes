# AWS: S3 and Lambda

1. Describe the cloud?
> "The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world.

2. What is a container?
> A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

3. What is auto-scaling?
> AWS Auto Scaling lets you set target utilization levels for multiple resources in a single, intuitive interface. You can quickly see the average utilization of all of your scalable resources without having to navigate to other consoles. For example, if your application uses Amazon EC2 and Amazon DynamoDB, you can use AWS Auto Scaling to manage resource provisioning for all of the EC2 Auto Scaling groups and database tables in your application.

4. What is bandwidth?
> Bandwidth is the data transfer capacity of a computer network in bits per second (Bps). The term may also be used colloquially to indicate a person's capacity for tasks or deep thoughts at a point in time.

5. How do cloud providers compute service costs?
> Cloud providers determine the expense to maintain the network.
They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor.
These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its cloud.

Server Instances: is a single copy of the software running on a single physical or virtual server.

Containers: A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

Cloud Services: a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. These services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources, without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware.

Cloud Architecture: the technology components that are combined to build a cloud, where resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network.

AWS: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the worldâ€™s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform.
