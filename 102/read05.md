# Loops
*Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code of block will run*

## For Loop
If you want to run a code a specific number of times, use a *for* loop.

## While Loops
If you don't know how many times the code should run, you can use the *while* loop.

## Do While
The do...while loop is very similar to the *while* loop, but has one key difference, it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once.
