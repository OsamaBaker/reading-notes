# CSS

>Block level elements look
like they start on a new line.
Examples include the <h1>-
<h6>, <p> and <div> elements.

>Inline elements flow within the
text and do not start on a new
line. Examples include <b>, <i>,
<img>, <em> and <span>.

**CSS** declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

# Color

The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:

1. rgb values
2. Hex Codes
3. Color Names
