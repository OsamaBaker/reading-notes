**Growth Mindset** is a state of mental *readiness* to grow and develop in your learning path and learn from others, not compare yourself to their level.

## Reminders:
1. Never stop trying and learn from your mistakes
2. Don't compare yourself to others, compare yourself to your past-self
3. Don't be afraid to ask questions and learn from others' experiences
