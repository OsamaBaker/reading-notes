### Class01 - Introduction to React and Components

#### Component Based Architecture

**1. What is a component?**
> A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.
*cited from www.tutorialspoint.com*

**2. What are the charactistics of a component?**
> Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

> Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

> Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

> Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

> Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

> Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

**3. What are the advantages of using component based architecture?**
> Ease of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

> Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

> Ease of development − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

> Reusable − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

#### What is Props and How to Use it in React

**1. What is props short for?**
> Props is short for **properties**, and is used to pass data from one component to another.

**2. How are props used in React?**
> 1. Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)
> 2. Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
> 3. Finally, render the Props Data

**3. What is the flow of props?**
> Props are uni-directional flow, which means, data flows in one direction.
