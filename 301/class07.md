1.Who is Roy Fielding?
> He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.

2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
> Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
> HTTP is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

4. What does a GET do?
> GET calls an element to be displayed on the webpage.

5. What does a POST do?
> If a system wants to add something to another system.

6. What does PUT do?
> If a system wants to replace something on another system.

7. What does PATCH do?
> To do a partial update.
