# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

1. What is functional programming?
> Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions.

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
> Given the same inputs, always returns the same output, and has no side-effects. We can know a pure function.

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
> referential transparency (you can replace a function call with its resulting value without changing the meaning of the program)

4. What is immutability?
> An immutable object is an object that can’t be modified after it’s created.

5. What is Referential transparency?
> you can replace a function call with its resulting value without changing the meaning of the program
