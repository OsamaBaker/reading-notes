## State and Props

#### React Life Cycle
1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
**Render**

2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
**Mounting**

3.  The following things in the order that they happen:
**constructor --> render --> React Updates --> componentDidMount --> componentWillUnmount**

4. What does componentDidMount do?
**componentDidMount() is invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree). Initialization that requires DOM nodes should go here. If you need to load data from a remote endpoint, this is a good place to instantiate the network request.**

#### React State Vs Props
1. What types of things can you pass in the props?
**The initial count**

2. What is the big difference between props and state?
**Props: you pass into the component, and state is handled inside of that component**

3. When do we re-render our application?
**Based if the user changes something**

4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
**Counter, Form**

## Retrospective
1. What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?
> Writing down the definitions of terms.

2. What did I learn today?
> I learned how to create a React App, and how to create and connect compnents together.

3. What should I do differently next time?
> I should write down important terms and techniques, and practice more on writing forEach statements.

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
> Callback functions puzzle me a little bit, I need to be comfortable using them.

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
> The assignment is complete.
